# About
I will work on [NLP 100 Exercise 2020 (Rev 2)](https://nlp100.github.io/en/).

> NLP 100 Exercise is a bootcamp designed for learning skills for programming, data analysis, and research activities by taking practical and exciting assignments.

<br />

If you find something wrong in my code or something that can be rewritten, please keep pointing it out to me.


# Chapers

1. ~~[Warm-up](https://nlp100.github.io/en/ch01.html)~~ [**Done(Feb 28, 2023)**](/Ch1) 
> Review advanced but important topics of programming, handling strings and text.

2. [UNIX commands](https://nlp100.github.io/en/ch02.html)
> Experience useful UNIX tools for research and data analysis. Improve programming skills and realize the ecosystem of existing tools by implementing these tools.

3. [Regular Expression](https://nlp100.github.io/en/ch03.html)
> Extract various information and knowledge by applying regular expressions to Wikipedia markups.

4. [POS tagging](https://nlp100.github.io/en/ch04.html)
> Obtain statistics of the word usage of the novel, “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland,” by applying a part-of-speech tagger

5. [Syntactic parsing](https://nlp100.github.io/en/ch05.html)
> Experience analysis and access to dependency trees by applying a dependency parser to the novel, “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.”

6. [Machine learning](https://nlp100.github.io/en/ch06.html)
> Build a document classifier based on machine learning. In addition, learn the evaluation methodology for machine learning.

7. [Word embeddings](https://nlp100.github.io/en/ch07.html)
> Learn the usage of word embeddings by computing the similarity between words and word analogy. In addition, experience clustering and visualization of word embeddings.

8. [Neural networks](https://nlp100.github.io/en/ch08.html)
> Learn the usage of a deep-learning framework, and implement a document classifier based on Neural Network models.

9. [RNN and CNN](https://nlp100.github.io/en/ch09.html)
> Implement Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by using a deep-learning framework.

10. [Machine translation](https://nlp100.github.io/en/ch010.html)
> Build a neural machine translation by using an existing tool.
